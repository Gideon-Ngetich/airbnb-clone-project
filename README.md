# Backend API Service  

## Project Overview  
A robust backend service providing REST and GraphQL APIs for [briefly describe application purpose - e.g. "a task management platform"]. Designed for scalability and maintainability with modern backend best practices.  

## Key Features  
- RESTful API (Django REST Framework)  
- GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries  
- JWT authentication  
- Asynchronous task processing  
- Containerized deployment  
- Automated CI/CD pipelines  

## Technology Stack  

### Core  
- **Framework**: Django 4.2+  
- **API Layer**: DRF 3.14, Graphene (GraphQL)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14  

### Infrastructure  
- **Caching**: Redis 7  
- **Async Tasks**: Celery + Redis broker  
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose  

### DevOps  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI  
- Monitoring: [Specify if applicable]  
- Logging: [Specify if using ELK/Sentry/etc]

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
- Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), and role-based access control (hosts/guests).  
- Enables secure account operations (profile updates, deactivation) and forms the core of all user interactions in the system.

### 2. Property Management
- Allows hosts to create, update, delete, and list properties with details like pricing, location, and amenities.  
- Serves as the foundation for the booking system, with availability tracking and search functionality.

### 3. Booking System
- Manages reservation lifecycle (create/modify/cancel bookings) with date conflict validation.  
- Calculates pricing dynamically and connects users to properties while enforcing business rules.

### 4. Review System
- Lets guests leave ratings and comments for properties they've booked.  
- Provides reputation metrics for hosts and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 5. Payment Processing
- Integrates with payment gateways to handle transactions securely.  
- Tracks payment statuses and triggers booking confirmations/refunds automatically via Celery tasks.

### 6. API Interfaces
- **REST API**: Standard CRUD endpoints for web/mobile clients  
- **GraphQL**: Flexible queries for complex data fetching (e.g., properties + reviews in one request)
